# BatchJ plugins


This work incorporates previosly published [iSBatch](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/MB/C5MB00321K#!divAbstract), a batch-processing platform for data analysis and exploration of live-cell single-molecule microscopy images and other hierarchical datasets.
The work will be slowly merged and curated for improved performance and extensibility.

Please report bugs and give your suggestions.
