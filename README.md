# BatchJ plugins


This work incorporates previosly published [iSBatch](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/MB/C5MB00321K#!divAbstract), a batch-processing platform for data analysis and exploration of live-cell single-molecule microscopy images and other hierarchical datasets.
The work will be slowly merged and curated for improved performance and extensibility.

Please report bugs and give your suggestions.

# Installation

The are two main ways of having ** BatchJ ** tools available within ImageJ or Fiji.

## Imagej

  Simply copy the most recent version of BatchJ by clicking [here](http://mylink) into your plugins folder.
  This also works for Fiji, although it is recommended to follow the instructions below to stay up to date.

## Fiji
  ** Recommended **

  The easiest way to keep up-to-date with recent developments and bug fixes is adding BatchJ/iSBatch to your list of site updates in Fiji. This will make life a lot easier!

 Note: There is already a complete tutorial [here](http://imagej.net/How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site).


Follow this steps:

  1. On your Fiji top bar, open ** Help/Update...**
  2. Wait for the current updates to take place.
  3. At the bottom, click ** Manage update sites ** and then click ** Add update site ** .
  4. BatchJ/iSBatch is not yet on the list of maintained Fiji/ImageJ plugins, so you have to add it manually. You just need to fill the empty fields with the following information:
    1.  ** Name ** : * BatchJ *
    2.  ** URL ** : http://sites.imagej.net/vcaldas/
    3.  ** Host ** : * webdav:Vcaldas *
  5. A list of plugins will appear. Right-clicking on "BatchJ_" and choose to install it.
  6. Close and it will be updated.
  7. Restart Fiji so the modifications can take place. An extra option should appear in your menu bar.
